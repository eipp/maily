# Maily Production Deployment Status Report

**Date:** March 1, 2025
**Status:** Partially Deployed

## Deployment Summary

This report documents the current status of the Maily production deployment and outlines what has been accomplished as well as what remains to be completed.

### Successfully Deployed Components

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created comprehensive `.env.production` file with all required credentials
   - Set up environment validation script (`scripts/validate-env-vars.sh`)
   - Created environment loading mechanism (`scripts/source-env.sh`)

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Supabase database connection configured and tested
   - Database migration scripts prepared

3. **AI Services**
   - AI model adapters configured in `apps/api/ai/adapters/config.json`
   - AI agent configuration established in `apps/api/ai/agents/octotools-config.json`
   - Vector database configuration created in `apps/api/ai/vector/vespa-config.json`

4. **Deployment Infrastructure**
   - Created Terraform configuration for AWS EKS in `infrastructure/terraform/eks/`
   - Created Kubernetes manifests for AI services in `kubernetes/deployments/ai-service.yaml`
   - Set up Vercel configuration in `vercel.json`

5. **Deployment Scripts**
   - Main deployment script: `scripts/master-deploy.sh`
   - Component-specific scripts:
     - `scripts/db-migration.sh`
     - `scripts/deploy-ai-services.sh`
     - `scripts/vercel-deploy.sh`
     - `scripts/commit-and-deploy.sh`
     - `scripts/create-k8s-secrets.sh`
   - Rollback functionality in `scripts/rollback.sh`
   - Smoke testing in `scripts/smoke-test.js`

6. **Documentation**
   - Deployment guide: `production-deployment-guide.md`
   - Deployment checklist: `deployment-checklist.md`

### Pending Deployment Components

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**
   - Need to set up actual AWS EKS cluster
   - Smoke test shows no connection to Kubernetes API

2. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Authentication issue with Vercel token
   - Frontend and API not deployed to Vercel

3. **DNS Configuration**
   - DNS records for `justmaily.com` and `api.justmaily.com` not resolving
   - Need to configure DNS entries in domain registrar or DNS provider

4. **Additional Services**
   - Redis cache service not deployed or connected
   - Message queue service not deployed
   - Blockchain verification nodes not connected

## Next Steps to Complete Deployment

1. **Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Execute Terraform configuration to create EKS cluster
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/terraform/eks
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
   - Configure kubectl to connect to new cluster
   ```bash
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name maily-production-cluster
   ```

2. **Vercel Authentication**
   - Verify Vercel API token: `NrS0JyyA872Ctki4xbezrLV4`
   - Generate new token if current token has expired
   - Deploy Frontend and API to Vercel
   ```bash
   ./scripts/vercel-deploy.sh production
   ```

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Create namespace and apply Kubernetes manifests
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace maily-production
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/namespaces/production.yaml
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployments/ai-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployments/redis.yaml
   ```

4. **DNS Configuration**
   - Configure DNS records for justmaily.com to point to Vercel
   - Configure DNS records for api.justmaily.com to point to Vercel
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

5. **Final Verification**
   - Run smoke tests after DNS propagation
   ```bash
   node scripts/smoke-test.js production
   ```

## Conclusion

The Maily deployment system has been fully configured with all necessary scripts, configurations, and documentation. The actual deployment to production infrastructure requires access to the following external services:

1. AWS account with permissions to create EKS clusters
2. Vercel account with valid API token
3. DNS provider for the justmaily.com domain
4. Active Supabase project

Once these requirements are met, the deployment can be completed using the provided scripts and configuration files.

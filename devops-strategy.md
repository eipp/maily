## 2. CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions with the following stages:

1. **Lint and Type Check**:
   - ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Black, isort, and flake8 for Python

2. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests

3. **Security Scanning**:
   - npm audit for JavaScript dependencies
   - Trivy for container vulnerability scanning
   - OWASP ZAP for web application security testing

4. **Build**:
   - Docker image building for all services
   - Next.js static optimization
   - Artifact generation

5. **Deployment**:
   - Staging deployment for verification
   - Production deployment with approval
   - Vercel deployment for frontend
   - Kubernetes deployment for backend services

### Deployment Strategy

- **Blue/Green Deployment**: For zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary Releases**: For gradual rollout of new features
- **Feature Flags**: For controlled feature releases

## 3. Monitoring and Observability

### Monitoring Stack

- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection

### Key Metrics

- **Infrastructure Metrics**:
  - CPU, memory, and disk usage
  - Network throughput and latency
  - Database performance

- **Application Metrics**:
  - Request rates and latencies
  - Error rates
  - Business metrics (email sends, opens, clicks)

- **AI Service Metrics**:
  - Inference latency
  - Model performance
  - Token usage

- **Blockchain Metrics**:
  - Transaction success rates
  - Gas usage
  - Contract execution metrics

### Alerting

- **SOC 2**: For service organization control

## 5. Scalability

### Scaling Strategies

- **Horizontal Scaling**: For stateless services
- **Vertical Scaling**: For database and cache services
- **Auto Scaling**: Based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
- **Load Balancing**: For distributing traffic

### Performance Optimization

- **Caching**: Redis for application caching
- **CDN**: CloudFront for static assets
- **Database Optimization**: Query optimization and indexing
- **Code Optimization**: Performance profiling and optimization

## 6. Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **S3 Backups**: For file storage
- **Configuration Backups**: For infrastructure and application configurations

### Recovery Procedures

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 1 hour
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 15 minutes
- **Failover Procedures**: Automated and manual failover procedures
- **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Regular testing of recovery procedures

## 7. Automation

### Automated Tasks

- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Using Terraform
- **Configuration Management**: Using Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets
- **Deployment**: Using GitHub Actions and custom scripts
- **Testing**: Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automated backup and recovery procedures

## 8. Developer Experience

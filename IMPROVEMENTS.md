# Maily Repository Improvements

This document consolidates all repository improvements made to create a state-of-the-art codebase organization and structure.

## Directory Structure

- ✅ Moved AI service into `apps/ai-service` for consistent service organization
- ✅ Created `docker/services/` directory with service-specific Dockerfiles
- ✅ Added detailed README files in each major directory
- ✅ Completed app directory migration from legacy structure
- ✅ Consolidated tests into a standardized directory structure

## Package Organization

- ✅ Added domain-driven packages structure:
  - `packages/domain/` - Shared domain models and business logic
  - `packages/ui-components/` - Reusable UI components with Storybook configuration
  - `packages/testing/` - Shared testing utilities and fixtures
  - `packages/config-schema/` - Configuration schema validation using Zod
  - `packages/api-client/` - Type-safe API client implementation
  - `packages/error-handling/` - Standardized error hierarchy and handling

## CI/CD and Quality Assurance

- ✅ Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows:
  - `ci.yml` - Builds, tests, and validates code quality
  - `cd.yml` - Handles deployment to staging and production
  - `quality.yml` - Performs additional quality checks
- ✅ Added code coverage configuration with CodeCov
- ✅ Implemented quality gates and security scanning
- ✅ Set up Husky pre-commit hooks for code quality validation
- ✅ Added lint-staged configuration for targeted linting
- ✅ Implemented commit message linting with conventional commits

## Documentation Enhancement

- ✅ Enhanced MkDocs configuration with improved navigation
- ✅ Created structured documentation folders:
  - `docs/api/` - API documentation
  - `docs/development/` - Development guides
  - `docs/internal/` - Internal architecture documentation
- ✅ Added installation and local development guides
- ✅ Created architectural overview documentation
- ✅ Added PR templates and GitHub workflows

## Infrastructure Organization

- ✅ Centralized Docker configuration in `docker/services/`
- ✅ Added common infrastructure components in `infrastructure/common/`
- ✅ Created standardized Dockerfile templates with best practices:
  - Multi-stage builds for web application
  - Security best practices (non-root users)
  - Health checks for all services
  - Proper metadata labels
- ✅ Created comprehensive docker-compose.yml for local development

## Dependency Management

- ✅ Added workspace configuration for better monorepo management
- ✅ Standardized package versioning and dependencies
- ✅ Created pre-commit hooks for dependency management
- ✅ Added post-merge hooks to automatically install dependencies

## Type Safety and Error Handling

- ✅ Implemented domain-driven design patterns with proper entities and value objects
- ✅ Added type-safe validation across the application
- ✅ Created reusable test fixtures for domain objects
- ✅ Implemented standardized error hierarchy and handling
- ✅ Added Zod validation integration
- ✅ Created error formatters and utilities

## Migration Notes

### App Directory Migration

The app directory structure has been updated to follow Next.js App Router conventions:
- ✅ Migrated page components to new directory structure
- ✅ Moved templates to dedicated section
- ✅ Updated routing configuration
- ✅ Migrated API routes to route handlers

### Test Consolidation

Tests have been consolidated into a standardized structure:
- ✅ Unit tests in `tests/unit/*`
- ✅ Integration tests in `tests/integration/*`
- ✅ E2E tests in `tests/e2e/*`
- ✅ Shared test utilities in `packages/testing/*`

## Benefits of Improvements

The repository now implements best practices from world-class engineering organizations:

1. **Modern monorepo architecture** with clear package boundaries
2. **Domain-driven design** with clean separation of concerns
3. **Standardized tooling** for consistent developer experience
4. **Comprehensive testing** infrastructure at all levels
5. **Complete CI/CD pipeline** for quality assurance and deployment
6. **Type safety** throughout the application
7. **Error handling** standardization
8. **Security best practices** built into the infrastructure
9. **Documentation** integrated into the development process

The repository is now optimized for efficient, scalable development by multiple teams, with a focus on maintainability, quality, and developer experience.

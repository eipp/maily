## Getting Started

### Accessing Predictive Analytics

1. Navigate to the **Analytics** section in the main navigation menu.
2. Select the **Predictive** tab to access the Predictive Analytics Dashboard.

### Understanding the Dashboard

The dashboard is divided into four main sections:

1. **Dashboard Overview**: A high-level view of your key metrics with predictions and top recommendations.
2. **Predictions**: Detailed forecasts for selected metrics with confidence scores and visualization.
3. **Recommendations**: AI-generated suggestions to improve your email marketing performance.
4. **Insights**: In-depth analysis of trends, patterns, and opportunities in your data.

### Working with Predictions

1. **Select a Metric**: Choose the metric you want to analyze from the available options.
2. **Choose a Model**: Select the prediction model that best fits your needs.
3. **Set Horizon**: Determine how far into the future you want to predict (1 day to 90 days).
4. **View Predictions**: See the predicted values along with confidence scores.
5. **Export Data**: Download prediction data for further analysis or reporting.

### Implementing Recommendations

1. **Review Recommendations**: Examine the AI-generated recommendations sorted by priority.
2. **Understand Context**: Each recommendation includes the reasoning behind it and expected impact.
3. **Take Action**: Implement the suggested changes in your email campaigns.
4. **Track Results**: Monitor the effects of your changes to validate the recommendations.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Prediction Models

You can create and train custom prediction models tailored to your specific needs:

1. Go to the **Models** section in the Predictive Analytics settings.
2. Click **Create New Model** and select the model type (Time Series, Regression, or Classification).
3. Configure the model parameters and select the training data.
4. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
5. Deploy the model for predictions.

### Recommendation Rules

Create custom recommendation rules to get alerts and suggestions based on your business requirements:

1. Navigate to the **Rules** section in the Predictive Analytics settings.
2. Click **Add Rule** and select the rule type (Threshold, Trend, Anomaly, or Comparison).
3. Configure the rule parameters, including metrics, thresholds, and conditions.
4. Set the priority and tags for the rule.
5. Save and activate the rule.

### Data Source Integration

Add new data sources to enrich your predictive analytics:

1. Go to the **Data Sources** section in the Predictive Analytics settings.
2. Click **Add Data Source** and select the source type (Database, API, or Event).
3. Configure the connection parameters and authentication.
4. Map the data fields to standardized metrics.
5. Test and activate the data source.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Key Metrics**: Focus on the most important metrics for your business, such as conversion rate and revenue.
2. **Use Multiple Models**: Different models excel at different types of predictions, so use a combination for best results.
3. **Consider Seasonality**: Account for seasonal patterns in your data when interpreting predictions.
4. **Validate Recommendations**: Test recommendations on a small segment before implementing them broadly.
5. **Regularly Retrain Models**: Update your models with new data to maintain prediction accuracy.
6. **Combine with Human Insight**: Use predictive analytics as a tool to enhance, not replace, human decision-making.

# Maily Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility standards and implementation guidelines for the Maily platform. Our goal is to ensure that Maily is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, in accordance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Accessibility Standards

Maily follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards. These guidelines are organized around four principles:

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Implementation in Maily

### Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements in Maily are accessible via keyboard:

- **Tab Navigation**: Users can navigate through all interactive elements using the Tab key.
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus indicators are provided for all interactive elements.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Common actions have keyboard shortcuts (documented in the UI).
- **No Keyboard Traps**: No part of the application traps keyboard focus.

### Screen Reader Support

Maily is designed to work with screen readers:

- **Semantic HTML**: We use semantic HTML elements to provide structure and meaning.
- **ARIA Attributes**: ARIA roles, states, and properties are used when HTML semantics are insufficient.
- **Dynamic Content Updates**: Screen readers are notified of dynamic content changes using aria-live regions.
- **Form Labels**: All form controls have associated labels.

### Visual Design

Our visual design considers accessibility:

- **Color Contrast**: Text and interactive elements have sufficient contrast ratios.
- **High Contrast Mode**: A high contrast mode is available for users who need it.
- **Text Resizing**: The interface remains usable when text is resized up to 200%.
- **Non-text Contrast**: UI components and graphical objects have sufficient contrast.

### Canvas Components

Special attention has been given to make our Canvas components accessible:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Canvas objects can be navigated and manipulated using the keyboard.
- **Screen Reader Announcements**: Changes to the canvas are announced to screen readers.
- **Alternative Controls**: Non-visual alternatives for canvas operations are provided.
- **High Contrast Support**: Canvas elements adapt to high contrast mode.

## Testing

We use several methods to ensure accessibility:

- **Automated Testing**: We use jest-axe and pa11y for automated accessibility testing.
- **Manual Testing**: Regular manual testing with keyboard-only navigation and screen readers.
- **User Testing**: Periodic testing with users who have disabilities.
- **Continuous Integration**: Accessibility tests are part of our CI pipeline.

## Accessibility Components

Maily includes several accessible components:

- **AccessibleButton**: A fully accessible button component.
- **AccessibleDialog**: A modal dialog with proper focus management.
- **AccessibleComboBox**: An accessible autocomplete input.
- **AccessibleDatePicker**: An accessible date selection component.
- **AccessibleTabs**: An accessible tabbed interface.
- **SkipNavLink**: A skip navigation link for keyboard users.

## Canvas Accessibility Features

Our Canvas components include these accessibility features:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab to navigate between objects, arrow keys to move objects.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Announcements for canvas actions and object selection.
- **High Contrast Mode**: Canvas adapts to high contrast settings.
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators for selected objects.
- **Alternative Text**: Support for alternative text on canvas objects.

## Accessibility Testing Tools

We use the following tools for accessibility testing:

- **jest-axe**: For unit testing components.
- **pa11y**: For automated accessibility testing of pages.
- **axe-core**: For in-browser testing during development.
- **Screen Readers**: NVDA, VoiceOver, and JAWS for manual testing.
- **Keyboard Testing**: Manual keyboard navigation testing.

## Continuous Improvement

Accessibility is an ongoing process. We:

- Regularly audit the application for accessibility issues.
- Keep up with evolving accessibility standards and best practices.
- Address accessibility bugs with high priority.
- Train developers on accessibility requirements and techniques.

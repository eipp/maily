# Repository Cleanup Summary

## 1. Completed Actions

### File Cleanup
- Removed database backup files (db_backup_development_*.sql)
- Deleted temporary files (temp-test directory, temp-package.json)
- Removed redundant AI service directory (kept apps/ai-service)
- Removed legacy directories (archived_migrations, app-backup)
- Removed duplicate Docker files from the root directory
- Consolidated GitHub workflow files
- Removed simple_test.py and other test clutter

### App Migration
- Fully migrated from app-new to app in the web application
- Copied all missing components (canvas, templates)
- Updated all files with newer versions
- Created backup of original app directory
- Documented migration in APP_MIGRATION_COMPLETED.md

### Test Consolidation
- Consolidated all tests into organized categories (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
- Moved fixed_tests into appropriate test directories
- Created proper test directory structure in root tests/ directory
- Documented test consolidation in TEST_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETED.md

### Configuration Standardization
- Created unified Next.js configuration file
- Removed duplicate config files (next.config.mjs, next.config.analyzer.js)
- Backed up original configuration files
- Documented configuration changes in NEXT_CONFIG_STANDARDIZATION.md

### Docker Standardization
- Created standardized Dockerfiles for all services in docker/services/
- Implemented multi-stage builds with security hardening
- Created unified docker-compose.yml file for local development
- Documented Docker best practices in DOCKER_STANDARDIZATION.md

## 2. Repository Structure

The repository now follows a clean, organized structure:

```

## 3. Benefits

- **Reduced clutter**: Removed ~100MB of unnecessary files
- **Improved maintainability**: Consistent structure across services
- **Better developer experience**: Single source of truth for configs
- **Enhanced security**: Hardened Docker containers
- **Simplified CI/CD**: Consolidated workflows
- **Clearer documentation**: Added specific documentation for key components

## 4. Next Steps

1. Update environment variables and secrets to align with new standardized configurations
2. Update CI/CD pipelines to use the new standardized Docker builds
3. Implement workspace-level dependency management to reduce duplication
4. Enhance automation scripts to maintain the clean structure

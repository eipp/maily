# Architecture Overview

Maily follows a microservices architecture with a monorepo structure, allowing for independent development and deployment of services while maintaining a unified codebase.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

- **Web Frontend**: Next.js application serving the user interface
- **API Service**: Main backend service handling business logic and data access
- **AI Service**: AI Mesh Network for intelligent content generation and optimization
- **Email Service**: Handles email delivery, tracking, and analytics
- **Analytics Service**: Processes and aggregates analytics data
- **Campaign Service**: Manages campaign creation, scheduling, and execution
- **Workers**: Background processing for asynchronous tasks

### Storage

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for structured data
- **Redis**: Caching and message broker
- **Object Storage**: Storage for email templates, images, and attachments

### Infrastructure

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for all services
- **Helm**: Package management for Kubernetes deployments
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for cloud resources

## Service Communication

Services communicate through:

1. **REST APIs**: Synchronous HTTP-based communication
2. **Message Queues**: Asynchronous communication for background tasks
3. **WebSockets**: Real-time updates and notifications
4. **gRPC**: High-performance internal service communication

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the Web Frontend
2. Frontend makes API calls to the API Service
3. API Service processes requests and communicates with other services
4. Data is stored in PostgreSQL and cached in Redis
5. Background tasks are delegated to Workers
6. Email Service sends emails and tracks interactions
7. Analytics Service processes engagement data

## Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: OAuth2 and JWT-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and HTTPS
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and CAN-SPAM compliance

## Scalability

The architecture is designed for horizontal scalability:

- Stateless services for easy replication
- Database sharding for data scalability
- Caching layers for performance optimization
- Auto-scaling based on load metrics

## Deployment Pipeline

1. Code is committed to the monorepo
2. CI/CD pipeline runs tests and builds artifacts
3. Artifacts are deployed to staging environment
4. Automated tests verify functionality
5. Manual approval for production deployment
6. Deployment to production with canary releases

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Metrics**: Prometheus for system and business metrics
- **Logging**: ELK stack for centralized logging
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager for notifications and alerts

## Failure Modes and Recovery

- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation of functionality
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region backup and recovery procedures

## Future Architecture

Planned enhancements to the architecture include:

- **Event Sourcing**: For more robust data consistency
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for improved performance
- **Edge Computing**: Move processing closer to users for lower latency
- **Serverless Components**: For specific high-scalability needs

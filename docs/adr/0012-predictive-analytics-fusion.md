# ADR 0012: Predictive Analytics Fusion Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-03-03

## Context

The Maily platform requires advanced analytics capabilities to provide users with predictive insights and AI-generated recommendations. This feature, called "Predictive Analytics Fusion," needs to unify analytics across platforms, provide predictive insights, and generate actionable recommendations.

Key requirements include:
- Aggregating data from multiple sources
- Implementing machine learning models for predictions
- Generating intelligent recommendations
- Providing interactive visualizations
- Ensuring enterprise-grade quality (performance, security, resilience)

## Decision

We will implement the Predictive Analytics Fusion feature with the following architecture:

### 1. Data Aggregation Layer

- **Technology**: Redis v7.0.5 for caching and data normalization
- **Design Pattern**: Adapter pattern for different data sources
- **Implementation**: Create a DataAggregationService that normalizes data from various sources
- **Data Flow**: Source systems → Adapters → Normalized storage → Analytics processing

### 2. Machine Learning Layer

- **Technology**: TensorFlow.js v4.10.0 for ML models
- **Model Types**: 
  - Time Series models (LSTM) for trend prediction
  - Regression models for relationship analysis
  - Classification models for categorization
- **Deployment**: Models will run in the browser for simple predictions and on the server for complex ones
- **Training**: Automated daily retraining with new data

### 3. Recommendation Engine

- **Technology**: Rule-based system with ML enhancement
- **Design Pattern**: Strategy pattern for different recommendation types
- **Implementation**: RecommendationService with pluggable recommendation strategies
- **Types**: Threshold-based, trend-based, anomaly-based, and comparative recommendations

### 4. Visualization Layer

- **Technology**: Recharts for React-based visualizations
- **Design Pattern**: Composite pattern for dashboard components
- **Implementation**: React components for different visualization types
- **Integration**: Direct integration with the Next.js frontend

### 5. API Layer

- **Technology**: Express.js REST API
- **Design Pattern**: Facade pattern to simplify complex operations
- **Implementation**: RESTful endpoints for data retrieval, model management, and recommendations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control

### 6. Integration with Existing Services

- **Analytics Service**: Extend with predictive capabilities
- **Campaign Service**: Consume recommendations for campaign optimization
- **Email Service**: Provide data for analysis and prediction
- **API Service**: Gateway for frontend access to predictive features

## Technical Details

### Data Flow

1. Raw data is collected from various sources (email campaigns, website analytics, etc.)
2. Data is normalized and stored in Redis for fast access
3. ML models process the data to generate predictions
4. Recommendation engine analyzes predictions and historical data
5. Results are exposed via API endpoints
6. Frontend components visualize the data and recommendations

### Performance Considerations

- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Horizontal scaling for the analytics service
- Batch processing for intensive computations
- Browser-based inference for simple models
- Server-side processing for complex models

### Security Measures

- Data encryption at rest (AES-256)
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Role-based access control for analytics features
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits

### Resilience Engineering

- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Retry policies with exponential backoff
- Fallback mechanisms for prediction failures
- Graceful degradation when ML services are unavailable

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Third-Party Analytics Platform

**Pros:**
- Faster implementation
- Managed infrastructure
- Built-in visualizations

**Cons:**
- Limited customization
- Data privacy concerns
- Higher long-term cost
- Dependency on external vendor

### 2. Dedicated Analytics Microservice

**Pros:**
- Complete separation of concerns
- Independent scaling
- Focused development

**Cons:**
- Increased operational complexity
- Additional network hops
- Potential data synchronization issues

### 3. Serverless Architecture

**Pros:**
- Automatic scaling
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Reduced operational overhead

**Cons:**
- Cold start latency
- Limited execution time
- Potential vendor lock-in
- Complexity in local development

## Consequences

### Positive

- Unified analytics across platforms
- Predictive capabilities enhance user decision-making
- AI-generated recommendations provide actionable insights
- Interactive visualizations improve user experience
- Scalable architecture supports future growth

### Negative

- Increased system complexity
- Additional infrastructure requirements
- ML model maintenance overhead
- Potential for false predictions or recommendations
- Higher computational resource usage

### Neutral

- Need for ongoing model training and evaluation
- Regular updates to recommendation strategies
- User education on interpreting predictions

## Implementation Plan

1. Develop data aggregation services
2. Implement ML model training and inference
3. Create recommendation engine
4. Build API endpoints
5. Develop frontend visualization components
6. Integrate with existing services
7. Conduct performance testing and optimization
8. Deploy to production with monitoring

## Compliance and Standards

- GDPR compliance for user data
- SOC 2 standards for security controls
- OpenAPI 3.1 for API documentation
- TensorFlow model format for ML models
- React component standards for frontend

## Monitoring and Metrics

- Model accuracy and confidence metrics
- Recommendation effectiveness tracking
- API performance monitoring
- User engagement with predictions
- System resource utilization

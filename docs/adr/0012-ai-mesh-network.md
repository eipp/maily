# ADR 0012: AI Mesh Network Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-03-03

## Context

As part of enhancing justmaily.com with advanced AI-driven features, we need to implement a collaborative network of specialized AI agents with shared memory and dynamic task delegation. This feature, called the "AI Mesh Network," will enable more sophisticated reasoning, better task specialization, and improved overall performance compared to using a single AI model.

The AI Mesh Network needs to be:
- Scalable to handle thousands of concurrent users
- Resilient to failures of individual components
- Secure to protect sensitive user data
- Extensible to allow adding new agent types and capabilities
- Integrated with the existing microservices architecture

## Decision

We will implement the AI Mesh Network as a new component within the existing AI Service, following these key architectural decisions:

1. **Agent Coordinator Pattern**: We will use a central coordinator agent that orchestrates the network of specialized agents, manages task delegation, and synthesizes results.

2. **Shared Memory System**: We will implement a persistent shared memory system using Redis to allow agents to build on each other's work and maintain context across tasks.

3. **Model Fallback Chain**: We will implement a fallback chain for LLM models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet → GPT-4o → Gemini 2.0) to ensure high availability and resilience.

4. **Hexagonal Architecture**: We will follow the hexagonal architecture pattern with clear separation of:
   - Domain logic (agents, tasks, memory)
   - Application services (coordination, task processing)
   - Infrastructure adapters (Redis, LLM APIs, database)

5. **REST API**: We will expose the AI Mesh Network functionality through a REST API that integrates with the existing API Gateway.

6. **Containerization**: We will package the AI Mesh Network as a containerized service that can be deployed and scaled independently.

7. **Circuit Breakers**: We will implement circuit breakers for all external service dependencies to prevent cascading failures.

8. **Observability**: We will add comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing to monitor the performance and health of the AI Mesh Network.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Components

1. **Agent Coordinator Service**:
   - Manages the lifecycle of AI Mesh Networks
   - Coordinates task delegation and processing
   - Synthesizes results from specialized agents

2. **Specialized Agents**:
   - Content Specialist: Generates and refines content
   - Design Specialist: Handles design and layout considerations
   - Analytics Specialist: Analyzes data and provides performance insights
   - Personalization Specialist: Handles audience targeting and personalization
   - Research Specialist: Gathers and analyzes information
   - Critic Agent: Reviews and provides feedback on outputs

3. **Shared Memory System**:
   - Redis-based persistent storage
   - Support for different memory types (facts, context, decisions, feedback)
   - Confidence scoring for memory items

4. **Task Management System**:
   - Task submission and tracking
   - Subtask creation and delegation
   - Result synthesis and delivery

### Data Model

1. **Network**:
   - ID, name, description
   - List of agents
   - List of tasks
   - List of memory items
   - Configuration (max iterations, timeout)

2. **Agent**:
   - ID, name, type
   - Model configuration
   - Capabilities
   - Status and metrics

3. **Task**:
   - ID, description, context
   - Status and priority
   - Subtasks and dependencies
   - Result and history

4. **Memory Item**:
   - ID, type, content
   - Confidence score
   - Metadata

### API Endpoints

1. **Networks**:
   - `POST /api/mesh/networks`: Create a new network
   - `GET /api/mesh/networks`: List all networks
   - `GET /api/mesh/networks/{id}`: Get network details
   - `DELETE /api/mesh/networks/{id}`: Delete a network

2. **Tasks**:
   - `POST /api/mesh/networks/{id}/tasks`: Submit a task
   - `GET /api/mesh/networks/{id}/tasks`: List tasks
   - `GET /api/mesh/networks/{id}/tasks/{id}`: Get task details
   - `POST /api/mesh/networks/{id}/tasks/{id}/process`: Process a task

4. **Memory**:
   - `POST /api/mesh/networks/{id}/memory`: Add a memory item
   - `GET /api/mesh/networks/{id}/memory`: Get memory items

### Infrastructure

1. **Deployment**:
   - Kubernetes-based deployment
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for scaling
   - Pod Disruption Budget for availability

2. **Persistence**:
   - Redis for shared memory and caching
   - PostgreSQL for long-term storage

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Prometheus for metrics
   - OpenTelemetry for tracing
   - Structured logging

4. **Security**:
   - TLS for all communications
   - API authentication and authorization
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single LLM with Chain-of-Thought**: Using a single LLM with chain-of-thought prompting instead of multiple specialized agents. This approach would be simpler but would not provide the same level of specialization and would be more limited in handling complex tasks.

2. **Serverless Architecture**: Implementing the AI Mesh Network as a collection of serverless functions. This approach would provide better scalability but would make it harder to maintain state and would increase latency due to cold starts.

3. **Distributed Agent Network without Coordinator**: Implementing a fully distributed network of agents without a central coordinator. This approach would be more resilient to coordinator failures but would significantly increase the complexity of task delegation and result synthesis.

4. **External Memory Store**: Using a dedicated vector database for shared memory instead of Redis. This approach would provide better semantic search capabilities but would add another dependency and increase operational complexity.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: The AI Mesh Network will enable more sophisticated reasoning and better task specialization.

2. **Improved Resilience**: The model fallback chain and circuit breakers will ensure high availability and resilience.

3. **Scalability**: The containerized deployment and horizontal scaling will allow handling thousands of concurrent users.

4. **Extensibility**: The modular architecture will make it easy to add new agent types and capabilities.

5. **Integration**: The REST API will enable seamless integration with the existing microservices architecture.

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity**: The multi-agent approach adds complexity compared to using a single LLM.

2. **Higher Resource Usage**: Running multiple LLM instances will consume more resources and increase costs.

3. **Potential for Coordination Overhead**: The coordinator pattern introduces a potential bottleneck and single point of failure.

4. **Increased Latency**: The multi-step process may increase latency compared to a single LLM call.

## Compliance and Standards

The AI Mesh Network implementation will adhere to the following standards and compliance requirements:

1. **SOC 2**: The implementation will follow SOC 2 principles for security, availability, and confidentiality.

2. **GDPR**: The implementation will ensure GDPR compliance for data processing and storage.

3. **API Standards**: The REST API will conform to OpenAPI 3.1 standards.

4. **Coding Standards**: The implementation will follow the project's coding standards and best practices.

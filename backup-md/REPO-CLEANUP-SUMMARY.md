# Repository Cleanup and Standardization

## Progress Summary (2025-03-04)

We've made significant progress in standardizing and cleaning up the codebase:

### 1. HTTP Client Standardization ✅
- **Standard**: `httpx` for all Python HTTP clients
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created and ran `scripts/standardize-http-clients.py`
  - Updated 9 files with 10 replacements
  - Marked legacy clients as deprecated in requirements.txt
  - Documentation added to CLAUDE.md and REQUIREMENTS.md

### 2. Redis Client Consolidation ✅
- **Standard**: `packages/database/src/redis/redis_client.py`
- **Implementation**:
  - Added deprecation notices to legacy implementations
  - Updated imports to use standardized client
  - Added documentation of the standardized approach
  - Benefits: circuit breaker pattern, connection pooling, standardized error handling

### 3. Testing Framework Standardization ✅
- **Standard**: Vitest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- **Implementation**:
  - Added deprecation notice to Jest configuration
  - Added documentation to CLAUDE.md
  - Will phase out Jest gradually to avoid breaking existing tests

### 4. Configuration File Cleanup ✅
- **Action**:
  - Moved backup Next.js configuration files to an archive directory
  - Created a script to handle Kubernetes .bak files
  - Verified that .bak files are no longer being tracked by git

### 5. OpenTelemetry Packages Standardization ✅
- **Standard**: Central requirements file
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `packages/config/monitoring/telemetry-requirements.txt`
  - Updated main requirements.txt to use the centralized file
  - Ensured consistent versioning across all OpenTelemetry packages

### 6. Documentation Updates ✅
- **New Documentation**:
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with standardized libraries and deprecated modules
  - Created REQUIREMENTS.md explaining requirements structure
  - Updated CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md with implementation progress
  - Created REPO-CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md (this file) for a high-level overview

## Next Steps

1. **Commit Changes**:
   - Review all changes for correctness
   - Create a PR with the standardization work

2. **Continue Standardization**:
   - Apply the same patterns to other duplicated implementations
   - Focus on error handling standardization next
   - Continue implementing the remaining cleanup tasks

3. **Developer Education**:
   - Schedule a knowledge-sharing session on the new standards
   - Make sure all team members are aware of the deprecated modules

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor for any issues after deployment
   - Track adoption of the new standardized patterns

## Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer implementation variations to maintain
- **Better Documentation**: Clear standards for new development
- **Improved Reliability**: Consistent error handling and connection management
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can more easily understand the codebase
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer packages to maintain and update

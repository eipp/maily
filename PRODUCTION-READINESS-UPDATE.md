We've addressed the key production readiness issues by implementing:

1. CORS configuration that now uses specific origins instead of '*'
2. API key validation with proper database and caching
3. Database connection pooling for optimal performance
4. Comprehensive rate limiting middleware
5. Circuit breaker pattern for external service resilience
6. Fixed placeholder template variables in Helm charts
7. Updated Docker image tags to use specific versions instead of 'latest'
8. Implemented proper trust verification with blockchain support

These changes have significantly improved the production readiness of the Maily application.

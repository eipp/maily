TEST CONSOLIDATION COMPLETED: All tests have been consolidated into the root tests/ directory with appropriate subdirectories for unit, integration, e2e, and performance tests. The fixed_tests directory has been removed, and all tests are now organized by type. Update your test running commands to point to the new locations.

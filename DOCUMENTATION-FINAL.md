## Architecture Overview

Maily is a microservices-based email marketing platform designed for high scalability, real-time collaboration, AI-powered content generation, and enterprise-grade security. The architecture consists of the following major components:

### Core Services

- **Frontend**: Next.js-based web application providing the user interface
- **API**: FastAPI-based backend service providing the core business logic
- **AI Service**: AI orchestration service with mesh network architecture
- **Analytics Service**: Real-time analytics and reporting service
- **Email Service**: Email delivery and tracking service
- **Workers**: Asynchronous task processing services

### Infrastructure Components

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for persistent storage
- **Redis**: Caching, pub/sub, and session management
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queue for asynchronous processing
- **Object Storage**: Storage for assets and email templates
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform

### Communication Patterns

- **REST APIs**: Synchronous communication between services
- **WebSockets**: Real-time updates and collaborative editing
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous task processing
- **Service Mesh**: Secure service-to-service communication

The architecture follows a domain-driven design approach with clear boundaries between services. Each service is independently deployable and scalable, with its own database schema and business logic.

## Core Features

### AI Mesh Network

The AI Mesh Network is a distributed AI processing system that enables scalable, fault-tolerant AI operations. It uses a mesh network topology to distribute AI workloads across multiple nodes, with each node specializing in different aspects of content generation, classification, and optimization.

#### Key Components

- **Agent Coordinator**: Orchestrates AI agents across the mesh
- **LLM Service**: Provides large language model integration
- **Memory Indexing**: Maintains context for personalized responses
- **Streaming Router**: Handles real-time streaming of AI responses
- **WebSocket Integration**: Provides real-time updates to the frontend

#### Architecture

The AI Mesh Network employs a hierarchical architecture with the following layers:

1. **Coordination Layer**: Manages task distribution and service discovery
2. **Processing Layer**: Executes AI workloads using specialized agents
3. **Memory Layer**: Maintains conversation context and user preferences
4. **Communication Layer**: Handles inter-node communication and client connections

Fault tolerance is achieved through redundant nodes, circuit breakers, and fallback mechanisms. Load balancing distributes tasks based on node capacity, specialization, and historical performance.

### Cognitive Canvas

Cognitive Canvas provides a collaborative editing environment for email content creation with AI assistance, performance insights, and trust verification visualization.

#### Key Components

- **Canvas Service**: Manages canvas state and operations
- **Visualization Service**: Provides visualization layers
- **Performance Insights**: Analyzes and visualizes email performance
- **Operational Transform**: Ensures consistent state in collaborative editing
- **WebSocket Integration**: Enables real-time collaboration

#### Visualization Layers

1. **AI Reasoning**: Visualizes AI decision-making process
2. **Performance Insights**: Shows email performance metrics
3. **Trust Verification**: Displays blockchain verification status

The Canvas uses a WebSocket-based real-time collaboration system with Operational Transform to handle concurrent edits. State synchronization ensures all users have a consistent view of the canvas.

### Trust Verification

Trust Verification provides blockchain-based verification of email content to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.

#### Key Components

- **Trust Verification Service**: Manages verification process
- **Blockchain Service**: Interacts with blockchain networks
- **Certificate Generation**: Creates verification certificates
- **Badge System**: Displays verification status in emails
- **QR Code Integration**: Allows recipients to verify authenticity

#### Verification Process

1. Email content is hashed and submitted to the blockchain
2. A verification certificate is generated and attached to the email
3. Recipients can verify authenticity by scanning a QR code or clicking a verification link
4. Verification status is displayed with a badge in the email

The system supports multiple blockchain networks and uses a circuit breaker pattern to ensure reliability during blockchain network issues.

### Predictive Analytics Fusion

Predictive Analytics Fusion combines real-time analytics, machine learning, and cross-platform data integration to provide actionable insights and recommendations.

#### Key Components

- **Analytics Service**: Collects and processes analytics data

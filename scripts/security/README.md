# Security Enhancement Scripts

This directory contains scripts for enhancing security across the Maily platform. These scripts implement various security measures and best practices to improve the overall security posture of the application.

## Available Scripts

### 1. Enhance Security Monitoring (`enhance_security_monitoring.py`)

This script implements security monitoring enhancements for the Maily platform, focusing on improving security event detection, alerting, and response capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Prometheus security alerts for detecting anomalous behavior
- Falco runtime security rules for Kubernetes environments
- Enhanced security headers for API and web applications
- Request size validation and rate limiting
- IP-based access control for admin endpoints

**Usage:**
```bash
# Apply security monitoring enhancements
python enhance_security_monitoring.py

# Show changes without applying them
python enhance_security_monitoring.py --dry-run

# Show detailed information during execution
python enhance_security_monitoring.py --verbose
```

### 2. Enhance Blockchain Security (`enhance_blockchain_security.py`)

This script implements security enhancements for the blockchain integration in the Maily platform, focusing on private key management, transaction validation, and monitoring.

**Key Features:**
- Integration with HashiCorp Vault for secure private key management
- Transaction validation to prevent unauthorized operations
- Monitoring for blockchain operations
- Enhanced security for document verification

**Usage:**
```bash
# Apply blockchain security enhancements
python enhance_blockchain_security.py

# Show changes without applying them
python enhance_blockchain_security.py --dry-run

# Show detailed information during execution
python enhance_blockchain_security.py --verbose
```

### 3. Rotate Secrets (`rotate_secrets.py`)

This script automates the rotation of secrets and credentials used throughout the Maily platform, ensuring that sensitive information is regularly updated.

**Key Features:**
- Automated rotation of API keys
- Database credential rotation
- JWT signing key rotation
- Integration with HashiCorp Vault for secrets management

**Usage:**
```bash
# Rotate all secrets
python rotate_secrets.py

# Rotate specific secret types
python rotate_secrets.py --types api_keys,jwt_keys

# Show changes without applying them
python rotate_secrets.py --dry-run
```

## Best Practices

When using these security enhancement scripts, follow these best practices:

1. **Always run in dry-run mode first** to understand the changes that will be made
2. **Run in a non-production environment** before applying to production
3. **Maintain a backup** of any files that will be modified
4. **Review logs** after execution to ensure all changes were applied correctly
5. **Update documentation** to reflect the security enhancements

## Integration with CI/CD

These scripts can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate security enhancements:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Security Enhancements

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Run weekly on Sunday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:     # Allow manual triggering

jobs:
  enhance-security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run security monitoring enhancements
        run: python scripts/security/enhance_security_monitoring.py

      - name: Run blockchain security enhancements
        run: python scripts/security/enhance_blockchain_security.py
```

# Next Steps for Maily Codebase Refactoring

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the codebase refactoring and standardization. All these steps should be completed before moving to production.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created standardized Redis client in `packages/database/src/redis/`
- ✅ Created standardized error handling in `packages/error_handling/` (both Python and TypeScript)
- ✅ Updated wrapper for legacy Redis client to use standardized client
- ✅ Updated main API service to use standardized error handling
- ✅ Added React error boundary components

## Remaining Tasks

### Update API Services with Standardized Error Handling

Update all services in the API to use the standardized error classes from the error handling package.

- [ ] Update `apps/api/services/*.py` to use the standardized error handling
- [ ] Replace custom error classes with standardized ones
- [ ] Update error responses to follow the standardized format

### Migrate All Redis Usage to Standardized Client

All Redis client usage should use the standardized client directly, rather than through wrappers or custom implementations.

- [ ] Update all services that use Redis to import from `packages/database/src/redis`
- [ ] Replace `apps/api/cache/redis.py` and `apps/api/cache/redis_service.py` usages
- [ ] Update AI service's `utils/redis_client.py` to use standardized client

### Update JavaScript/TypeScript Codebase for Error Handling

Update all frontend code to use the standardized error handling.

- [ ] Use `ErrorBoundary` components in all key UI components
- [ ] Update API client code to use error handling utilities
- [ ] Update error displays to use standardized formats and components

### Update Docker and Kubernetes Configurations

Standardize Docker and Kubernetes configurations for all services.

- [ ] Update Dockerfiles to follow the same pattern
- [ ] Update Kubernetes manifests for consistency
- [ ] Ensure proper resource limits and health checks

### Migrate Jest Tests to Vitest

Complete migration of all Jest tests to Vitest.

- [ ] Update all Jest configuration files to Vitest
- [ ] Convert all test files to use Vitest syntax
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline to use Vitest

### Consolidate HTTP Client Usage

Standardize on `httpx` for Python HTTP clients.

- [ ] Replace `requests`, `aiohttp`, and other HTTP client libraries with `httpx`
- [ ] Create utilities for common HTTP client patterns
- [ ] Update services that make HTTP requests

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with the most critical services first:
   - Authentication/authorization services
   - Core API handlers
   - Database access services

2. Create automated tests to verify correctness:
   - Unit tests for each standardized component
   - Integration tests for services using standardized components
   - End-to-end tests for critical workflows

3. Perform thorough code reviews:
   - Check for any missed instances of non-standardized components
   - Verify correct error handling
   - Ensure consistent pattern usage

4. Update documentation:
   - Update API documentation to reflect standardized error formats
   - Document standardized component usage patterns
   - Create examples for teams

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Complete error handling migration (API services, middleware)
- **Week 2**: Complete Redis client migration and test thoroughly
- **Week 3**: Update frontend components and Docker/Kubernetes configurations
- **Week 4**: Complete HTTP client migration and Vitest updates
